# Neighbour Hood map Project
## This is the front end project for udacity's "Full Stack Web development". 
## The project requires you to develop a neighbourhood map that has markers on it indicates places of your choice

# Project Idea
I have choose to implement a map that lays in fort launderdale and if you're a hungry person then you'll probably love this website.
Why? Because i made it about locations of restaurant so you can check which restaurant to go when you're hungry and for some reason in fort launderdale.

# How was this project implemented
This project was implemented using vanilla js, knockoutjs for mvvm and UI bindings and jquery's function AJAX to request API's asynchronously. This was for the functionality of the website, as for the map i used google maps api.
